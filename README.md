# About

This is a proof-of-concept in defining a *catalog of software concepts*, as described in [The Essence of Software (EOS)](https://essenceofsoftware.com/), which can be used as composable building blocks to create applications.

## Definition

Software concepts (hereafter just *concepts*) all have these principles in common:

- Concepts have purposes
- Concepts are behavioral
- Concepts have rich state
- Concepts localize data models
- Concepts are generic
- Concepts are freestanding
- Concepts differ from abstract data types and objects
- Concepts differ from features
- Concepts differ from mental models

## Formal Notation

The concepts here are defined in [Alloy 6](https://alloytools.org/alloy6.html), rather than the informal, plain English descriptions in EOS.
