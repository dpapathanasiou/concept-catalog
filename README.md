# About

This is a proof-of-concept in defining a *catalog of software concepts*, as described in [The Essence of Software (EOS)](https://essenceofsoftware.com/), which can be used as composable building blocks to create applications.

# Formal Notation

The concepts here are defined in [Alloy 6](https://alloytools.org/), rather than the informal, plain English descriptions in EOS.

Corrections, edits, additions, and other suggestions in the form of [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) are welcome!
