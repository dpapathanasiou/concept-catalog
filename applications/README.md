This folder contains examples of how to compose [concepts](../concepts/) into application definitions, as [Alloy](../README.md#formal-notation) models.

The resulting [predicates](https://alloytools.org/spec.html#functions-and-predicates) effectively describe the application API, synchronizing the related actions according to the composition.

Note that by using generic and freestanding concepts which individually have proper assertions, the application models themselves do not need addition verification for correctness (though nothing prevents additional checks at the application level as well).
